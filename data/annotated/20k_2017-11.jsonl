Truchet patterns usually make use of one block, consisting\n\tof three strategically placed tori designed to intersect the centers of all cube faces.\n\n\tThis particular pattern introduces another variation that consists of two tori intersecting four \n\tfaces and a straight segment that runs through opposing faces. The resultant pattern has more of a \n\trandom pipework look -- as opposed to the standard snake-like one. By the way, you could save a \n    lot of extra decision making and use just the second tile, but I feel the pattern lacks a little\n\tvariance when doing that.\n\t\n\tAnyway, apart from some extra decision making and construction, the code doesn't differ too much \n\tfrom regular examples. By the way, I can thank Mattz for reminding me of a concept that I'd forgotten, \n\twhich helped me speed up the distance field equation. Without it, this example would run much slower.\n\tI've described it briefly somewhere in among the distance field setup.\n\n\tWhilst on the subject of optimization, I should probably mention that I often take shortcuts with\n\tthe distance field equations in order to save the GPU extra calculations. For instance, I'll use a \n\tbound, like \"max(max(x, y), z),\" for a cube instead of the correct - but usually more expensive - \n\tone. For the most part, you can get away with it, but things like shadows, etc, can be affected. \n\tIQ has an example that illustrates the point here:\n\n\tRotational symmetry - iq\n\thttps://www.shadertoy.com/view/XtSczV\n\n\t\n\tBased on:\n\n\t// Same concept, but with one tile, which makes it easier to comprehend.\n\tCubic Truchet Pattern - Shane\n\thttps://www.shadertoy.com/view/4lfcRl\n\n\tOther Truchet examples:\n\n\t// 3D Truchet flow.

I'm not entirely sure how to describe it, but I\n\tguess it resembles a microbial dust flythough. :) Either way, there's nothing new \n\there - I just thought it'd be fun to make.\t\n\n\tThere are two common ways to apply volumetrics to a distance field: One is to\n\tstep evenly through the field accumulating layer colors at each point. Layers \n\tare assigned a weight according to the distance from the viewer. \n\n\tThe other method is to sphere-trace to the surface, then accumulate color once\n\tthe ray crosses a certain surface distance threshold. The color weighing is \n\tcalculated according to distance from the surface.  \n\n\tThe first method gives an overall gaseous kind of effect. The latter method \n\tdisplays more of the underlying surface and is the one I'm using here. You can \n\talso use hybrids of the two. There's no right or wrong way to do it. It all \n\tdepends on what you're trying to achieve.\n\n\tVolumetric calculations are generally more expensive, due to the number of steps\n\tinvolved, and the need to calculate lighting at each one. In a perfect world, \n\tyou'd calculate normals (numerically, or analytically, if possible), etc, to give \n\tbetter results. Unfortunately, that's expensive, so it's common to use a cheap \n\t(directional derivative) lighting trick to get the job done. If you're interested, \n\tIQ explains it here:\n\n    Directional Derivative - www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/derivative/derivative.htm\n\n\tI've tried to keep the GPU workload down do a dull roar, but that was at the\n\texpense of quality via various detail sacrifices.

The meteor code from \"2D fractal trees\" by pyBlob: (the meteor routines) https://www.shadertoy.com/view/Mt33Dn\n \n 3.  +Todor Arnaudov's (Twenkid/Tosh) additions and integration. \n\n 4. Music: https://soundcloud.com/jrhodespianist/clair-de-lune-debussy\n \n [ Warning: Work in progress! Experiments and dirty code are present! ]\n\n// Version history:\n//\n// 13-11-2017: Added rotation of the Moon and corrected the glowing routine,\n//             so that it does not light up the landscape when the moon is under the horizon.\n//\n// 14-11-2017: Masked the moon out from the stars, varied the gradient of the light,\n//             optimized glowing after BigWIngs'suggestions.\n//\n//             However it appeared that the glow is correct even *without* masking,\n//             thus moonGlow was turned off.\n// \n// Work needed: [FIXED] There's a \"light leakage\" below horizon, perhaps due to\n//              \"black/0\" values of the landscape and trees contours.\n//\n//       Ideas: Drawing it inverted, starting from 1.0 and subtracting, or just quitting\n//             after any non-zero operation/marking a flag - a simple hit-check.\n\n   15-11-2017:  The light leakage was fixed: \n                vec4 mask = mix(col, trees, trees.a)*(1.-trees.a);\n                col = max(mask, trees);\n\n   16-11-2017: #define NEWMOON - experimental with noise textures, changed starsMasked (using .a).\n               Looks bad in full screen. A better and smoother crater generation is needed.\n               This one seems out of the style of the trees and the landscape.\n\n   19-11-2017: Returned the Bingwing's moonglow (fixed a bug in the masking in the moonglow function )\n               Meteors were added! (pyBlob routines)\n               Have been working on mapping of NickWest's craters to a sphere (moon). That shader is still a draft, though.\n               Strange bugs/black borders, noise on my main Windows machine, while on an older Linux computer it runs correctly,\n               both with Intel integrated GPUs. Something related to the noise generation routines/the fract-float-... implementations, I guess.\n\n   18-12-2017: Added Debussy's \"Claire de Lune\" as a soundtrack. Moon slowed down in order to sync it. /5. slowTrees = 0.6\n               \n// Future work: \n//\n// 1. [DONE] (credit: pyBlob): A falling star. Probably drawn in the moonglow routine in order\n//    to use the mask and the position of the moon, in order to synchronize it\n//    when the moon is below the horizon and then draw the meteor in the darkest part of the sky.\n//\n// 2. Trees swinging\n//\n// 3. Leafs and/or cones flying/rolling.\n//\n// 4. Day cycle - Moon sets, then Sun dawns, the sky turns blue, \n//    then the colors of the trees and the landscape get natural - brown, green.\n//\n// 5. Winter - snow falls and covers the trees and the landscape.\n//\n*/\n\n#define PI 3.1415\n#define S(x,y,z) smoothstep(x,y,z)\n#define B(x,y,z,b) S(x, x+b, z)*S(y+b, y, z)\n#define saturate(x) clamp(x,0.,1.)\n\n#define MOD3 vec3(.1031,.11369,.13787)\n\n#define MOONPOS vec2(1.3, .8)\n\n//twenkid\n\n#define NEWMOON 1  //Experimental with noise textures - one higher resolution and one lower\n#undef NEWMOON\n\n\nfloat slowTrees=0.66;

The scene is supposed \n\tto look a little artificial or cartoony, so I wouldn't take it too seriously. :)\n\n\tThere are plenty of realistic cloud shaders on Shadertoy, so I thought I'd do a stylized\n\tversion. Plus, I had to cheap out on everything, so realism wasn't exactly an option. :)\n\tThe colors and contrast have deliberately been exaggerated to give it more of a surreal \n\tfeel. The ramped up contrast also serves to allow the viewer to more easily discern the \n\tindividual cloud shapes. \n\n\tIn case anyone was wondering, the cloud shapes were emphasized by assigning a much higher \n\tweighting to the larger low frequency base layers. Giving the clouds a denser look was a \n\tstyle choice, but it's possible to make them fluffier and more traditional looking with \n\ta few tweaks here and there.\n\n\tOne of the things you figure out pretty quickly when doing this kind of thing is that when \n\tyou don't have enough iterations to work with, fake physics tend to work better than real\n\tphysics. For real shadows, you need to traverse toward the light several times. In this \n\texample, you're doing so just once, which is bordering on pathetic. :) Therefore, it's \n\tnecessary to darken the one-tap shadow value to give the impression that more shadowing \n\tis happening. However, you'll never produce a real shadow cast, no matter how hard you try.\n\n\tIt'd be nice to put up an example with volumetric shadowing, etc, but I don't think the\n\taverage GPU is quite fast enough yet.
